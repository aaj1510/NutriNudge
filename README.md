# NutriNudge
> Hangman game created in python with multiple categories to choose from.
This game is a modified version of Hangman, whose rules / description 
can be found at https://github.com/rrice2004/Python-Hangman/tree/main
We adopted inspiration on how the gameflow would be (guessing and progress functions), and ignored
the narrations.

Origins. Our game, NutriNudge drew inspiration from a Python hangman project available on GitHub, where we encountered an implementation that featured multiple categories to choose from. This project not only served as a foundation for our creation but also showcased the potential for making an impact through promotion of healthy food habits. The inspired project can be found from: https://github.com/rrice2004/Python-Hangman/tree/main

Objective: This game was designed to teach healthy food eating habits with the incorporation of “Healthy Plate”, as defined by Health Promotion Board. As such, the objective of the game is to win 3 themed categories (Fruits and vegetables, Proteins, and Carbohydrates), with a hangman twist. Additionally,  NutriNudge not only promotes the association of healthy eating with fun and games, but also aids in developing their vocabulary and spelling skills.
